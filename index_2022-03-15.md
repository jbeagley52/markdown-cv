## Projects
<!-- 
**Markdown Previewer**

This web application was made in JavaScript using a combination of React, Sass, and Bootstrap. It contains a Markdown editor and a window that displays a real-time preview of the rendered Markdown. -->

**Alfred Wiki Search**

Alfred workflow written in Python. The program uses the MediaWiki API to send queries and then parses the responses (in JSON) so that a selection of the results can be previewed within Alfred, providing a more streamlined search interface.

**Is That In The Dictionary? Game**

Text-based game written in Python. Players take turns entering letters. If the letters that they enter can be used to form a word (whether as given or in the form of an anagram), then the player who entered the last letter loses.
